# Standard Input(stdin) and Standard Output(stdout)

## Most times when coding we do what is called hard coding which basically deals with inputing data directly to your source code. eg. char c = 'a'; (This outputs 'a' as the value, everytime our code is compiled). Now this input assigned cannot be changed externally, so if we want a different output we will have to edit our script and change that line of code everytime. So to avoid this we use what is called ##stdin 


## stdin - is a standard input for reading data. stdin is a file stream that links to your keyboard requesting that a value be inputed.

# WHILE  

## stdout - is a standard output for writing data. stdout on the other hand points to your terminal. So with this function you can be able to view the output of your code.
